# Breast-Cancer-prediction

This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the likelihood of cancer based on historical data.

The project achieves an accuracy of approximately 95% on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the predictive models in diagnosing breast cancer.
